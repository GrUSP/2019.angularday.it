  title: "Level up your NgRx game"
  extract: >
    State management can get really complex for scaled Angular applications. And, NgRx can be an answer for the complexity of this problem. 
    This talk will cover some of the best practices of building an NgRx Angular app. We'll go through building a good action hygiene, efficiently using schematics, improving your apps performance with one-way data binding and memoized selectors, reducing the boilerplate with entities/schematics and introducing ngrx-data.
    After this session, you'll have more control on the NgRx platform with the grasp of entities, memoized selectors, effects and schematics.
